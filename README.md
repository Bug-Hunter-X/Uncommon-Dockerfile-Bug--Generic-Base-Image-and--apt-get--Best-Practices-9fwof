# Uncommon Dockerfile Bug: Generic Base Image and `apt-get` Best Practices

This repository demonstrates an uncommon but important bug in a Dockerfile: using a generic base image and neglecting best practices for `apt-get`.

## Bug Description
The provided Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest`, which is an excessively generic base image.  This leads to:

* **Larger image sizes:**  The base image includes many packages not needed for the application.
* **Inconsistent behavior:** The specific packages and versions within `ubuntu:latest` can change unexpectedly across updates, leading to build failures on different systems.
* **Security vulnerabilities:**  The latest version isn't always the most secure. A specific, tagged image offers reproducible builds and better security management.

Moreover, the `apt-get` commands lack best practices:
* `--no-install-recommends`: Prevents the installation of recommended packages not explicitly needed, reducing image size.
* `apt-get clean` and `apt-get autoremove`:  Removes unnecessary packages after installation, shrinking the image further.

## Bug Solution
The `Dockerfile.fixed` demonstrates the improved Dockerfile with a specific, slimmer base image and proper `apt-get` usage.
